## 📌 Why I Built This

Reading long articles online can be time-consuming — especially when you're just looking for the key points or trying to quickly understand complex topics. I wanted to create a tool that helps people **save time, stay focused**, and **learn faster**.

That’s why I built **AI Summary Creator for Articles** — a Chrome extension that uses the power of AI to automatically generate clean, concise summaries of any article with a single click.

This project was also a way for me to:

- Explore how **AI and browser extensions** can work together
- Practice working with **content scripts and DOM extraction**
- Improve the user experience for everyday reading and research tasks
- Learn how to build and design usable tools that solve real problems

Whether you're a student, researcher, or just a curious reader, this tool helps you get the **essence of any article instantly** — right from your browser.


To try the extension on your own browser without publishing it:

1. **Clone or download this repository**:
   ```bash
